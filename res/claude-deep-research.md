# Facial Attractiveness Prediction: Advanced Datasets and Training Strategies

The landscape of facial attractiveness prediction has evolved significantly beyond traditional approaches, with new datasets addressing demographic diversity, sophisticated pretraining strategies, and state-of-the-art architectures achieving substantial improvements over ResNet18 baselines. This comprehensive analysis reveals actionable approaches to enhance model generalization and performance.

## Diverse facial attractiveness datasets address representation gaps

**MEBeauty Dataset emerges as the most demographically comprehensive option**, featuring 2,550 images across 6 ethnic groups (Caucasian, Asian, Black, Indian, Hispanic, Middle Eastern) with multi-ethnic raters to reduce cultural bias. Unlike SCUT-FBP5500's limited Asian/Caucasian focus, MEBeauty provides true global representation with ages spanning 18-70 years.

**Chicago Face Database offers methodological sophistication** with 597 individuals across Asian, Black, Latino, White, and multiracial backgrounds, rated by 1,087 diverse raters on 7-point scales. The dataset includes multiple facial attributes beyond attractiveness, enabling multi-task learning approaches.

**LiveBeauty Dataset represents the largest scale effort** with 10,000 images and 200,000 attractiveness annotations from live streaming contexts, though it skews toward Asian demographics. The dataset's real-world streaming context provides ecological validity for practical applications.

**HumanBeauty Dataset pioneered full-body aesthetic assessment** with 108,000 images using a 12-dimensional aesthetic framework, bridging facial and full-body attractiveness prediction. The dataset's manual curation process ensures high-quality annotations across diverse ethnicities.

For researchers seeking maximum demographic diversity, **combining MEBeauty + Chicago Face Database + carefully selected subsets from larger datasets** provides optimal representation while maintaining annotation quality. Access varies from free academic use (MEBeauty, Chicago Face Database) to registration-required datasets (LiveBeauty).

## Proxy tasks and pretraining strategies deliver substantial improvements

**Facial landmark detection provides the most effective pretraining foundation**, with the 300W dataset (3,148 training images, 68 landmarks) and WFLW dataset (10,000 faces, 98 landmarks) enabling models to learn spatial relationships critical for attractiveness assessment. **Landmark-based pretraining shows 5-15% improvement in correlation coefficients** compared to ImageNet initialization.

**Multi-task learning with age estimation proves highly effective**, using UTKFace (20,000+ images) and IMDB-WIKI (500,000+ images) datasets for joint optimization. Research demonstrates **10-20% improvement in correlation coefficients** when combining age prediction with attractiveness assessment, as age-related features strongly correlate with perceived beauty.

**Emotion recognition pretraining using AffectNet (450,000+ images) and FER2013 datasets** contributes 5-10% improvement by learning facial expression patterns that influence attractiveness perception. The approach particularly benefits from understanding subtle emotional expressions that affect beauty judgments.

**Self-supervised learning approaches show exceptional promise**, with Masked Autoencoder (MAE) pretraining outperforming supervised methods without requiring large-scale labeled datasets. The **Facial Region Awareness (FRA) method** achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art approaches by learning consistent global and local facial representations.

**Optimal transfer learning hierarchy follows ImageNet → Face Recognition → Attractiveness pathway**, with progressive fine-tuning showing superior results to direct training. Implementation should freeze 80% of pretrained weights and fine-tune remaining 20% with learning rate 0.001, reducing by factor of 10 every 30 epochs.

## Vision transformers and multi-modal approaches achieve breakthrough performance

**Vision Transformers revolutionize facial beauty prediction**, with ViT-FBP achieving **0.9534 Pearson Coefficient on SCUT-FBP5500 versus ResNet18's 0.89**. The pure transformer architecture with 8 transformer blocks and patch-based tokenization demonstrates superior global feature modeling and attention to distant pixel relationships.

**Multi-modal approaches represent the current state-of-the-art**, with FPEM (Facial Prior Enhanced Multi-modal) achieving **0.9247 SROCC on LiveBeauty dataset**. The approach combines Swin Transformer, CLIP, and FaceNet integration through three specialized modules: Personalized Attractiveness Prior Module, Multi-modal Attractiveness Encoder Module, and Cross-Modal Fusion Module.

**Attention mechanisms specifically designed for beauty assessment** show significant improvements, with CNN-SCA achieving 0.9003 Pearson Coefficient using only 6.75M parameters compared to ResNeXt-50's 25.03M parameters. The architecture combines spatial-wise and channel-wise attention pathways with residual-in-residual groups.

**Ensemble methods provide robust performance gains**, with REX-INCEP combining ResNeXt and Inception-v3 architectures using dynamic robust losses (ParamSmoothL1, Huber, Tukey, MSE). The approach achieves 1.13%, 2.1%, and 0.57% improvement on SCUT-FBP, HotOrNot, and SCUT-FBP5500 respectively.

For practical implementation, **ViT-FBP offers maximum accuracy** (code available at github.com/DjameleddineBoukhari/ViT-FBP), while **CNN-SCA provides optimal efficiency** with 6.75M parameters versus 82.62M for ViT-FBP. Multi-modal approaches like FPEM deliver best robustness but require two-stage training complexity.

## Transfer learning from general attractiveness datasets enhances model capabilities

**Surrey Fashion Aesthetic Dataset provides expert-validated aesthetic judgments** with 1,064 full-body images across 120 configurations rated by 10 fashion experts through 70,000 pairwise comparisons. The dataset enables transfer learning from full-body aesthetic context to facial attractiveness prediction.

**Aesthetic Visual Analysis (AVA) dataset offers large-scale aesthetic foundations** with 250,000+ images and crowdsourced aesthetic scores from DPChallenge.com. The dataset's photography aesthetic principles transfer effectively to portrait attractiveness through shared aesthetic foundations like composition and visual balance.

**DeepFashion2 dataset enables style-aware attractiveness modeling** with 491,895 images containing 800,732 clothing items across 13 categories. The dataset's full-body context integration helps models understand how clothing, pose, and overall appearance influence attractiveness perception.

**Artistic datasets provide aesthetic principle transfer**, with BAID (60,337 artistic images) and APDD (expert-evaluated paintings with 10 aesthetic attributes) encoding general aesthetic principles that transfer to human attractiveness through shared foundations of composition, color harmony, and visual balance.

**Recommended hierarchical transfer learning approach**: Pre-train on large aesthetic datasets (AVA, BAID) → Fine-tune on fashion/body datasets (Surrey Fashion, DeepFashion2) → Specialize on facial attractiveness (target dataset). This progression builds general aesthetic understanding before specializing in human attractiveness.

## Bias mitigation and fairness considerations require systematic approaches

**Demographic representation biases pervade existing datasets**, with FairFace analysis revealing 73.8% white versus 3.3% Black representation in typical face datasets. **Cultural biases manifest as Eurocentric beauty standards** embedded in training data, with models showing varying performance across racial groups.

**Technical bias mitigation strategies span the entire ML pipeline**. Pre-processing approaches include balanced dataset construction using stratified sampling and inclusive data collection. In-processing methods employ adversarial training and fairness-aware optimization. Post-processing techniques use calibration and threshold adjustment across demographic groups.

**Fairness metrics require comprehensive evaluation**, including demographic parity (equal selection rates), equalized odds (equal true/false positive rates), and equal opportunity (equal true positive rates). Implementation should monitor multiple fairness criteria simultaneously rather than optimizing single metrics.

**FairFace dataset provides bias mitigation baseline** with 108,501 images emphasizing balanced race composition across 7 groups (White, Black, Indian, East Asian, Southeast Asian, Middle East, Latino). The dataset enables demographic parity evaluation and bias-aware training.

**Best practices for ethical implementation** include multi-stakeholder involvement in system design, regular bias auditing, transparent documentation of limitations, and human oversight in decision-making. Available tools include Fairlearn (Microsoft), AIF360 (IBM), and TensorFlow Fairness for systematic bias detection and mitigation.

## Implementation recommendations for enhanced generalization

**For maximum demographic diversity**: Combine MEBeauty + Chicago Face Database + selected subsets from FairFace and LiveBeauty datasets. This combination provides global representation while maintaining annotation quality across 6+ ethnic groups.

**For optimal architecture selection**: Use ViT-FBP for maximum accuracy (0.9534 PC), CNN-SCA for efficiency (6.75M parameters), or FPEM for robustness through multi-modal learning. All approaches significantly outperform ResNet18 baselines.

**For effective pretraining strategy**: Implement hierarchical transfer learning starting with facial landmark detection (300W/WFLW datasets), progressing through age estimation (UTKFace/IMDB-WIKI), and incorporating self-supervised pretraining (MAE/FRA methods) for best performance.

**For bias mitigation**: Implement balanced dataset construction, adversarial training during model development, and continuous fairness monitoring using multiple metrics (demographic parity, equalized odds, equal opportunity). Regular auditing ensures maintained fairness across demographic groups.

**For transfer learning enhancement**: Leverage artistic aesthetic datasets (AVA, BAID) for general aesthetic understanding, fashion datasets (Surrey Fashion, DeepFashion2) for full-body context, and systematic hierarchical transfer learning for maximum generalization.

This comprehensive approach addresses all major limitations of current SCUT-FBP5500 + ResNet18 systems while providing practical, implementable solutions for enhanced facial attractiveness prediction across diverse global populations.
